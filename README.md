# Breast Cancer Prediction with Logistic Regression

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict breast cancer (malignant vs benign) based on features from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset.

##  What I Did

- Explored the **math & geometry** behind logistic regression
- Cleaned and standardized the dataset
- Evaluated using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix**
- Achieved **96% accuracy**
- Discussed limitations: high-stakes domain needs near 100% recall

##  Model Evaluation

Key metrics:
- Accuracy: 96%
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score: Evaluated using `classification_report`
- Confusion Matrix: Visualized to assess true/false positives/negatives

##  Files

- `breast_cancer_logistic_regression.ipynb`: Full Colab notebook with code and outputs

## Future Work

- Try advanced models (SVM, Random Forest)
- Handle class imbalance
- Improve recall for malignant class
